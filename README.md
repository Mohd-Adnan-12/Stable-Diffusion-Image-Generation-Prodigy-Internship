# Stable Diffusion Image Generation  
### Generative AI Internship – Prodigy InfoTech (Feb 2026)

This project implements an AI-powered image generation system using the **Stable Diffusion v1.5** pre-trained model.

The system takes a user-defined text prompt as input and generates high-quality images using deep learning techniques.
